# Visual Question Answering

## Introduction

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a widely studied problem in Machine Learning that lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. The goal of VQA is to analyze an image and answer a question posed about that image. First, the system processes the inputs: extracting visual features from the image and parsing the natural-language question. Next, the VQA model combines these two sources of information to generate a coherent, context-aware answer. Building a highly accurate VQA system therefore requires strong performance in both visual understanding and language understanding, making the task particularly challenging.
